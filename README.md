Content-Based Recommendation System â€“ Using Image classification and Text Generation
This project aims to provide product recommendations based on title text, description text, and images. There are two approaches for this project:
- Text-Based Product Recommendation will use Bag of words, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec.
- Image Based Product Recommendation: Using CNN Deep Learning Techniques.
Goal: Develop a recommendation system capable of accepting user input in the form of images, product titles, and descriptions, and provide personalized recommendations based on the content of the images as well as the textual information such as titles and descriptions of products.
